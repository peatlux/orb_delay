# orb_delay

Its a delay which circles through your head.
Since it works with higher order ambisonics (HOA) headphone use is recommended.

It runs on a supercollider server and thus can be used for the SPRAWL - System (https://hvc.berlin/projects/sprawl_system/).   
There is an additionally pure data patch to controll the delay parameters with OSC messages. 

In the "local" folder is a version of the server with some testing sounds and parameter settings.
